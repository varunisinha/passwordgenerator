## DESCRIPTION 
You will find a simple javascript powered app that allows the user to create a random password by answering multiple prompts. The user will be prompted to choose the length of the password, provided it's between a 8 and 125 characters. The user will be prompted to include uppercase characters, lowercase characters, numbers or special characters. Based on whether or not these criteria are chosen, the password will be created and displayed on the text area on the screen. 

## YOUR TASK
This week’s homework requires you to modify starter code to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that they’ve selected. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.
The password can include special characters. If you’re unfamiliar with these, see this list of password special characters from the OWASP Foundation.
